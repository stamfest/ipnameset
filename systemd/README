The ipnameset.timer and ipnameset.service files should be suitable for most
systemd based systems.

The ipnameset-create.service is currently designed to work with raspian 
systems using the netfilter-persistent.service to handle iptables setup
during boot.

Installation:

Create the directory /etc/ipnameset and populate it with .ip4 and .ip6 
files.

Copy the timer and service files to /etc/systemd/system and enable / start 
them:

    systemctl enable ipnameset.timer ipnameset.service ipnameset-create.service
    systemctl start ipnameset.timer
