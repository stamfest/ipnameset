Manages ipset based sets of IP addresses by using DNS information.

The ipnameset utility creates and atomically updates existing ipsets based
on lists of hostnames.

The ipnameset-helper wraps ipnameset and handles ipsets based on files in
the /et/ipnameset directory.

Files with an .ip4 extension are turned into IPv4 ipsets named like the file 
(without the extension) where every line corresponds to a hostname or an
IPv4 address.

The same is done for files with an .ip6 extension but for IPv6 addresses.

The systemd directory contains examples for a timer to take care of updateing
name based ipsets (with the corresponding service) and a service suitable
to just create ipsets early on during system boot, so that other services
(eg. restoring of iptables entries referencing an ipset) have the ipsets 
available when they need them.

Installation:

Copy the ipnameset and ipnameset-helper files from bin to /usr/local/bin
